# home_assistant
Personal configuration of home assistant os. Its primary aim is sensor data collecting, visualization, and notifications (mobile) when a parameter is met (e.g. high-temperature reading). It works almost in real-time (collects reading in a set time interval of 1 min by default but can be configured as low as 1 sec without sensor malfunction). Utilizes home assistant mobile app to provide access to data and more importantly push notifications.

Features a custom-made html document embedded in an iframe window in the dashboard, containing mainly a table with temperature measurements at specific times throughout the day. This is useful in cafes, restaurants, or any fridge-storing application where the state (or private stakeholder) will carry over quality controls. Usually, a printed report is required.
